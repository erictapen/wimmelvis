                        <h3>Separating trash correctly can be hard and
                        sometimes you just hope for the best...</h3>
                        <p>... but with rising numbers of trash produced each year, we all can help a little bit by separating our trash correctly.
                        While reducing waste production is the best option, correct recycling can help with the sorting process of the trash
                        afterwards, or make the reuse of important materials possible or keep harmful substances out of the enviroment. There are a 
                        lot of different rules and you can find differences between almost all cities and districts. Some allow meat
                        in the compost, some don’t. In some places old pots and pans are allowed in the yellow recycling bin and elsewhere they
                        aren’t. We took Berlin and the rules of the BSR as an example, but it is always best to check online what applies in
                        your area. There are also some general rules and often wrongly recycled items, which we collected in an explorative
                        picture puzzle. Find the recycable items and learn more about how to dispose of them correctly and why it is important.
                        Everything applies only to unusable items, there are a lot of great ways to gift or sell usable but unwanted items, for
